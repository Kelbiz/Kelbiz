### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Neil Kelly. -

Currently still operating our own business together with my wife Jackie.
Our business is consultancy, in the areas of accounting software and IT infastructure. I have been a MYOB Partner for 22 years and Microsoft partner for about 24 years.
Microsoft has given me access to many great things like software for our Server OS's and now Visual Studio 2022.
We sell and service computer hardware, and manage domains, emails and servers.

- ðŸ™Œ I also dabble in programming, writing for some 15 years in Access VBA using it as a backend link into MYOB data files.
Yes ... you might have gathered already that I am aging towards 75!!
- ðŸ”­ I have completed several courses in programming but continue to use Access ... probabably a security blanket!
However I am sick of missing references in Access between versions so I thought I might upgrade the brain a little!
- ðŸŒ± I found an interesting training manual from Mark J Price. Purchased C# 9;
Got to the end and bought C# 10 and .Net 6.
Hopefully have better luck with this although it could be a 5 year plan.
- ðŸ‘¯ We have many ideas on applications and had one written (well sort of!) by a programmer in India. 
He got less interested each time I asked for an update. We have the source code but it is now a matter of deciphering it ... rather convoluted.

- neil@kelbiz.com.au or neilk@psionyx.com.au
- Still learning about GitHub also.
